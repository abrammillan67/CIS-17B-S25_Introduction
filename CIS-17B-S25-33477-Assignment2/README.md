Hello, I will give you instructions on how to run this program, first off, I am on a Mac so your commands might be different.

To run this program in your terminal, please use the command:

"g++ main.cpp" 

This command will use g++ to compile the project and create an a.out file for you.

You may use the command " ls " to list the files and you should see an a.out file in the folder now.

Finally, to run the program us the following command:

"./a.out"

This will run the program and the program will continue to run until the user chooses the menu option to exit the program.
